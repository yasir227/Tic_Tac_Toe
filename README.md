## Purpose
This app was created to learn the basics of AI and how to create a simple AI that can play tic tac toe against the user. I practice using the tkinter library and to practice using functions in Python.


## Technologies and Libraries Used
- Programming Language
    - Python
- Libraries
    - tkinter


## Setup
Make sure to git clone this repository. After cloning, make sure the latest version of Python and all mentioned packages are installed and the project is ready for use!


## Repository Information
The main.py file contains the code for the GUI and the functions that allow the user to play against the computer. 


## Usage
To use the application, run the main.py file. This will open the GUI. 
The GUI will look like this:

<kbd><img src="image.png" width="300"></kbd>


- To use the application, enter the number where you want to place your X in the input box and click the submit button. 
- The computer will then place an O in an attempt to win the game. 
- The game will continue until either the user or the computer wins or the game ends in a tie.
